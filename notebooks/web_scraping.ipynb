    "## Smartphone Market Analysis & Price Prediction using Web Scraping – Flipkart Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on performing live web scraping from Flipkart to extract real-time smartphone data using Python libraries such as Requests and BeautifulSoup. The rapidly evolving smartphone market, characterized by frequent product launches and dynamic pricing, makes automated data collection essential for continuous insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extraction, the data undergoes a comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that the information — including product names, prices, ratings, discounts, and key technical specifications (RAM, Storage, Battery, Display, Processor, Camera) — is accurate and analysis-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned dataset is then used to train a machine learning model that predicts smartphone prices based on technical specifications, enabling data-driven insights into pricing patterns and feature impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results are visualized in Power BI, providing a complete end-to-end workflow — from live data collection to ML-based predictive analysis — demonstrating practical expertise in:\n",

    "### Phase 1 - Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this project is to collect real-time smartphone data from Flipkart using Python web scraping tools such as Requests and BeautifulSoup. This phase focuses on extracting all essential product information to build a rich and reliable dataset for downstream analysis and machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we will scrape smartphone listings from **Flipkart** to capture essential details such as:  \n",
    "- Brand & Model  \n",
    "- Price & Discounts  \n",
    "- Ratings  \n",
    "- Key Specifications (RAM, ROM, Display, Battery, Processor, Camera, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The scraped dataset will be stored in a structured format (CSV) and used in the next phase for transformation and analysis."
