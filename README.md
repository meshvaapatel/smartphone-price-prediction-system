# AI-Powered Smartphone Price Estimator - ML & Data Science Project

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full data science pipeline, from live data collection to a deployed machine learning model. It starts by scraping real-time smartphone data from Flipkart, followed by comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering.

The core of the project is a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained to predict smartphone prices based on their technical specifications.  

The final product is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, where users can input a phone's features and receive an instant price prediction from the trained AI model.

### 🧭 Project Workflow

The project is structured into four main phases, mirroring a real-world data science workflow:

1. **Web Scraping**  
   Collected over 900 smartphone listings from Flipkart using `Python`, `Requests`, and `BeautifulSoup` to build a dataset reflecting current market conditions.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   Processed the raw scraped data using `pandas`.  
   Extracted and standardized features like RAM, Storage, Display, Processor, and Battery using regex and string processing.

3. **Machine Learning Modeling**  
   Built and optimized a prediction model using `scikit-learn`’s `RandomForestRegressor` within a pipeline.  
   Hyperparameter tuning was performed using `RandomizedSearchCV` to improve accuracy.

4. **Deployment**  
   Created an interactive web interface with `Streamlit`.  
   Users can adjust smartphone specifications and receive a **real-time price prediction** generated by the saved ML model.
